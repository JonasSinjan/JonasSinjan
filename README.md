### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Jonas

- From Belgium, but lived in the UK, USA, Australia and now Germany!
- 
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on data from the newly launched Solar Orbiter (Feb 2020 is new in space missions). In particular I am heavily involved in the processing and analysis of data from the PHI (Polarimeter Helioseismic Imager), which was partly developed where I now work as a PhD student: the Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research in Goettingen, Germany.
- ðŸŒž PHI measures the photospheric vector magnetic field and the line-of-sight velocity. This is critical to a better understanding of the Sun, the magnetic field dominates the processes that happen on the Sun, and inform us about potential Space Weather events!
- ðŸŒŽ PHI is the first instrument of it's type to view the Sun from a viewpoint other than that from the Earth

- ðŸš² When my head is not completely immersed in the Sun, I am most likely spending time with my loved ones and/or being active: like training for an upcoming triathlon.
